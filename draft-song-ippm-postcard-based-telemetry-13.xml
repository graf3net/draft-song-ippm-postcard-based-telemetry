    <abstract>
      <t>The document describes a packet-marking variation of the IOAM DEX
      option, referred to as IOAM Marking. Similar to IOAM DEX, IOAM Marking
      does not carry the telemetry data in user packets but send the telemetry
      data through a dedicated packet. Unlike IOAM DEX, IOAM Marking does not
      require an extra instruction header. IOAM Marking raises some unique
      issues that need to be considered. This document formally describes the
      high level scheme and cover the common requirements and issues when
      applying IOAM Marking in different networks. IOAM Marking is
      complementary to the other on-path telemetry schemes such as IOAM trace
      and E2E options.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Motivation">
      <t>To gain detailed data plane visibility to support effective network
      OAM, it is essential to be able to examine the trace of user packets
      along their forwarding paths. Such on-path flow data reflect the state
      and status of each user packet's real-time experience and provide
      valuable information for network monitoring, measurement, and
      diagnosis.</t>

      <t>The telemetry data include but not limited to the detailed forwarding
      path, the timestamp/latency at each network node, and, in case of packet
      drop, the drop location, and the reason. The emerging programmable data
      plane devices allow user-defined data collection or conditional data
      collection based on trigger events. Such on-path flow data are from and
      about the live user traffic, which complements the data acquired through
      other passive and active OAM mechanisms such as <xref
      target="RFC7011">IPFIX</xref> and <xref
      target="RFC2925">ICMP</xref>.</t>

      <t>On-path telemetry was developed to cater to the need of collecting
      on-path flow data. There are two basic modes for on-path telemetry: the
      passport mode and the postcard mode. In the passport mode which is
      represented by <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"> IOAM trace option
      </xref>, each node on the path adds the telemetry data to the user
      packets (i.e., stamp the passport). The accumulated data-trace carried
      by user packets are exported at a configured end node. In the postcard
      mode which is represented by <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export"> IOAM direct export option
      (DEX) </xref>, each node directly exports the telemetry data using an
      independent packet (i.e., send a postcard) to avoid carrying the data
      with user packets. The postcard mode is complementary to the passport
      mode.</t>

      <t>IOAM DEX uses an instruction header to explicitly instruct the
      telemetry data to be collected. This document describes another
      variation of the postcard mode on-path telemetry, IOAM Marking. Unlike
      IOAM DEX, IOAM Marking does not require a telemetry instruction header.
      However, IOAM Marking has unique issues that need to be considered. This
      document discusses the challenges and their solutions which are common
      to the high-level scheme of IOAM Marking.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IOAM Marking: Marking-based IOAM Direct Export">
      <t>As the name suggests, IOAM Marking only needs a marking-bit in the
      existing headers of user packets to trigger the telemetry data
      collection and export. The sketch of IOAM Marking is as follows. If
      on-path data need to be collected, the user packet is marked at the path
      head node. At each IOAM Marking-aware node, if the mark is detected, a
      postcard (i.e., the dedicated OAM packet triggered by a marked user
      packet) is generated and sent to a collector. The postcard contains the
      data requested by the management plane. The requested data are
      configured by the management plane. Once the collector receives all the
      postcards for a single user packet, it can infer the packet's forwarding
      path and analyze the data set. The path end node is configured to unmark
      the packets to its original format if necessary.</t>

      <t>The overall architecture of IOAM Marking is depicted in Figure 1.</t>

      <t>The advantages of IOAM Marking are summarized as follows.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>1: IOAM Marking avoids augmenting user packets with new headers
          and the signaling for telemetry data collection remains in the data
          plane.</t>

          <t>2: IOAM Marking is extensible for collecting arbitrary new data
          to support possible future use cases. The data set to be collected
          can be configured through the management plane or control plane.</t>

          <t>3: IOAM Marking can avoid interfering with the normal forwarding.
          The collected data are free to be transported independently through
          in-band or out-of-band channels. The data collecting, processing,
          assembly, encapsulation, and transport are, therefore, decoupled
          from the forwarding of the corresponding user packets and can be
          performed in data-plane slow-path if necessary.</t>

          <t>4: For IOAM Marking, the types of data collected from each node
          can vary depending on application requirements and node
          capability.</t>

          <t>5: IOAM Marking makes it easy to secure the collected data
          without exposing it to unnecessary entities. For example, both the
          configuration and the telemetry data can be encrypted and/or
          authenticated before being transported, so passive eavesdropping and
          a man-in-the-middle attack can both be deterred.</t>

          <t>6: Even if a user packet under inspection is dropped at some node
          in the network, the postcards collected from the preceding nodes are
          still valid and can be used to diagnose the packet drop location and
          reason.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="challenge" title="New Challenges">
      <t>Although IOAM Marking has some unique features compared to the
      passport mode telemetry and the instruction-based IOAM DEX, it
      introduces a few new challenges.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Challenge 1 (Packet Marking): A user packet needs to be marked to
          trigger the path-associated data collection. Since IOAM Marking does
          not augment user packets with any new header fields, it needs to
          reserve or reuse bits from the existing header fields. This raises a
          similar issue as in <xref target="RFC8321">the Alternate Marking
          Scheme</xref></t>

          <t>Challenge 2 (Configuration): Since the packet header will not
          carry IOAM instructions anymore, the data plane devices need to be
          configured to know what data to collect. However, in general, the
          forwarding path of a flow packet (due to ECMP or dynamic routing) is
          unknown beforehand (note that there are some notable exceptions,
          such as segment routing). If the per-flow customized data collection
          is required, configuring the data set for each flow at all data
          plane devices might be expensive in terms of configuration load and
          data plane resources.</t>

          <t>Challenge 3 (Data Correlation): Due to the variable transport
          latency, the dedicated postcard packets for a single packet may
          arrive at the collector out of order or be dropped in networks for
          some reason. In order to infer the packet forwarding path, the
          collector needs some information from the postcard packets to
          identify the user packet affiliation and the order of path node
          traversal.</t>

          <t>Challenge 4 (Load Overhead): Since each postcard packet has its
          header, the overall network bandwidth overhead of IOAM Marking can
          be high. A large number of postcards could add processing pressure
          on data collecting servers. That can be used as an attack vector for
          DoS.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="IOAM Marking Design Considerations">
      <t>To address the above challenges, we propose several design details of
      IOAM Marking.</t>

      <section title="Packet Marking">
        <t>To trigger the path-associated data collection, usually, a single
        bit from some header field is sufficient. While no such bit is
        available, other packet-marking techniques are needed. We discuss
        several possible application scenarios.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>IPv4. <xref target="RFC8321">Alternate Marking (AM)</xref> is
            an IP flow performance measurement framework that also requires a
            single bit for packet coloring. The difference is that AM does
            in-network measurement while IOAM Marking only collects and
            exports data at network nodes (i.e., the data analysis is done at
            the collector rather than in the network nodes). AM suggests to
            use some reserved bit of the Flag field or some unused bit of the
            TOS field. Actually, AM can be considered a sub-case of IOAM
            Marking, so that the same bit can be used for IOAM Marking. The
            management plane is responsible for configuring the actual
            operation mode.</t>

            <t>SFC NSH. The OAM bit in the NSH header can be used to trigger
            the on-path data collection <xref target="RFC8300"/>. IOAM Marking
            does not add any other metadata to NSH.</t>

            <t>MPLS. Instead of choosing a header bit, we take advantage of
            <xref target="I-D.bryant-mpls-synonymous-flow-labels"> the
            synonymous flow label </xref> approach to mark the packets. A
            synonymous flow label indicates the on-path data should be
            collected and forwarded through a postcard.</t>

            <t>SRv6: A flag bit in SRH can be reserved to trigger the on-path
            data collection <xref target="I-D.song-6man-srv6-pbt"/>. <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-6man-spring-srv6-oam">SRv6 OAM</xref> has adopted
            the O-bit in SRH flags as the marking bit to trigger the
            telemetry.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Flow Path Discovery">
        <t>In case the path that a flow traverses is unknown in advance, all
        IOAM Marking-aware nodes should be configured to react to the marked
        packets by exporting some basic data, such as node ID and TTL before a
        data set template for that flow is configured. This way, the
        management plane can learn the flow path dynamically.</t>

        <t>If the management plane wants to collect the on-path data for some
        flow, it configures the head node(s) with a probability or time
        interval for the flow packet marking. When the first marked packet is
        forwarded in the network, the IOAM Marking-aware nodes will export the
        basic data set to the collector. Hence, the flow path is identified.
        If other data types need to be collected, the management plane can
        further configure the data set's template to the target nodes on the
        flow's path. The IOAM Marking-aware nodes collect and export data
        accordingly if the packet is marked and a data set template is
        present.</t>

        <t>If the flow path is changed for any reason, the new path can be
        quickly learned by the collector. Consequently, the management plane
        controller can be directed to configure the nodes on the new path. The
        outdated configuration can be automatically timed out or explicitly
        revoked by the management plane controller.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="correlation"
               title="Packet Identity for Export Data Correlation">
        <t>The collector needs to correlate all the postcard packets for a
        single user packet. Once this is done, the TTL (or the timestamp, if
        the network time is synchronized) can be used to infer the flow
        forwarding path. The key issue here is to correlate all the postcards
        for the same user packet.</t>

        <t>The first possible approach includes the flow ID plus the user
        packet ID in the OAM packets. For example, the flow ID can be the
        5-tuple IP header of the user traffic, and the user packet ID can be
        some unique information pertaining to a user packet (e.g., the
        sequence number of a TCP packet).</t>

        <t>If the packet marking interval is large enough, the flow ID is
        enough to identify a user packet. As a result, it can be assumed that
        all the exported postcard packets for the same flow during a short
        time interval belong to the same user packet.</t>

        <t>Alternatively, if the network is synchronized, then the flow ID
        plus the timestamp at each node can also infer the postcard
        affiliation. However, some errors may occur under some circumstances.
        For example, two consecutive user packets from the same flows are
        marked, but one exported postcard from a node is lost. It is difficult
        for the collector to decide to which user packet the remaining
        postcard is related. In many cases, such a rare error has no
        catastrophic consequence. Therefore it is tolerable.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Control the Load">
        <t>IOAM Marking should not be applied to all the packets all the time.
        It is better to be used in an interactive environment where the
        network telemetry applications dynamically decide which subset of
        traffic is under scrutiny. The network devices can limit the packet
        marking rate through sampling and metering. The postcard packets can
        be distributed to different servers to balance the processing
        load.</t>

        <t>It is important to understand that the total amount of data
        exported by IOAM Marking is identical to that of IOAM trace option.
        The only extra overhead is the packet header of the postcards. In the
        case of IOAM trace option, it carries the data from each node
        throughout the path to the end node before exporting the aggregated
        data. On the other hand, IOAM Marking directly exports local data. The
        overall network bandwidth impact depends on the network topology and
        scale, and in some cases IOAM Marking could be more bandwidth
        efficient.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Implementation Recommendation">
      <section title="Configuration">
        <t>Access lists with an optional sampler, <xref target="RFC5476"/>,
        should be configured and attached at the ingress of the IOAM
        encapsulation node's to select the intended flows for IOAM.</t>

        <t>Based on the IOAM marking, the flow data should be exported at each
        IOAM transit and at the end at the decapsulation node with IPFIX <xref
        target="RFC7011"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Data Export">
        <t>The data decomposition can be achieved on the IOAM node exporting
        the data or on the IPFIX data collection. <xref
        target="I-D.spiegel-ippm-ioam-rawexport"/> describes how data is being
        exported when decomposed at IPFIX data collection. When being
        decomposed on the IOAM node the data can be aggregated according to
        section 5 of <xref target="RFC7015"/>. The following IPFIX entities
        are of interest to describe the relationship to the forwarding

    <section title="Use Cases">
      <t>The MPLS Design Team has been investigating extensibility options for
      the MPLS data plane.</t>

      <t>The challenge has been to continue to support existing MPLS
      architecture, backwards compatibility as well as not excessively
      increase the depth of the MPLS label stack with a variety of functional
      SPL labels and NAI indicators similar in concept to the MPLS Entropy
      label ELI, EL added to the label stack, as well as the MPLS extension
      headers being in Stack or post stack.</t>

      <t>Reference Augmented Forwarding (RAF) <xref
      target="I-D.raszuk-mpls-raf-fwk"/> utilizes In Stack Data (ISD) with
      parity to Entropy Label stack {TL,RFI,RFV,AL} and control plane
      extension to distribute special network actions and forwarding
      behaviors.</t>

      <t>Reference Augmented Forwarding (RAF) keeps the ISD and PSD stack
      depth in check by using an alternative means of carrying the IOAM data
      using IGP control plane extension TLV to carry the data to provide
      In-Situ IOAM on path telemetry using the postcard based telemetry.</t>

      <t>The MPLS Design Team may come up with other alternatives to carry
      IOAM data such as the IGP extension mentioned and maybe other solutions,
      which will heavily rely on the the postcard based solution.</t>

      <t>With Segment Routing SR-MPLS and SRv6 as Maximum SID Depth(MSD) as
      well as PMTU in SR Policy are critical issues for SR path instantiation
      by a controller, postcard based telemetry will become a critical
      solution to ensure that IOAM telemetry can be viable for operators by
      eliminating IOAM data from being carried in-situ in the SR-TE policy
      path.</t>

      <t>This draft provides a critical optimization that fills the gaps with
      IOAM DEX related to packet marking triggers using existing mechanisms as
      well as flow path discovery mechanisms to avoid configuration of on path
      data plane node complexity and helps mitigate SR MSD and PMTU
      issues.</t>

          <t>Eavesdrop and tamper: the postcards can be encrypted and
          authenticated to avoid such security threats.</t>

          <t>DoS attack: IOAM Marking can be limited to a single
          administrative domain. The mark must be removed at the egress domain
          edge. The node can rate-limit the extra traffic incurred by
          postcards.</t>
